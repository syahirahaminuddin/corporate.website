	<h3>Folk Tale of Sabah’s Ethnic Groups Origins</h3>
		<img src="images/culture1.jpg" height="300px">
		<p>Sabah's population is heterogeneous and culturally diverse, with more than 30 different ethnic races and over 80 local dialects spoken. The origins of the ethnic groups are charmingly “explained” in an old folk tale that originates in legend and history and is a legacy from Sabah’s oldest people. The tale speaks of a place called Nunuk Ragang, the original Sabahan’s Garden of Eden, somewhere in the heart of Sabah. A river ran through it with a nunuk or a banyan tree on its bank. The native children loved to play in the river and climb the huge branches of the banyan tree to sun themselves – which is how true Sabahans got the golden glow on their skins. People lived happily together and multiplied. Very soon, Nunuk Ragang got too crowded. Families had to move out in search of new places to live. Some went across valley plains and settled as farmers while others made their way up to the highlands and learned to hunt and reap the bounty of jungles. Some trekked as far as the east coast and settled there. And that was how the people spread across the land. </p><br>

		<p>Many of the ethnic groups share a similar oral history, languages and traditions. However, lack of communication due to rugged terrains has resulted in the evolution of many dialects in common languages, different dress styles, handicrafts and cultures. The largest indigenous ethnic group is Kadazan-Dusun, followed by Bajau, and Murut. Traditions and customs have long been part of Sabahans’ daily lives.</p> <br>

		<p>One will normally ask what kinds of people live in this land of eco-treasures. Often by further understanding their spectrum of cultures, one will find the answer as all types, colours and creeds. All these ethnic groups live together harmoniously while at the same time preserving their own culture, traditions, festivals and customs to make Sabah a multicultural and exotic experience unlike any other that you might have already experienced.</p>

	<center><h4>The Kadazandusun Tribe</h4></center>
		<img src="images/culture2.jpg" height="400px">
		<p>This is the largest ethnic category in Sabah and is predominantly wet rice and hill rice cultivators. Their language belongs to the Dusunic family and shares a common animistic belief system with various customs and practices. Their ancient beliefs on the verity that everything has life - the rocks, trees, and rivers are all living things. Now many have migrated to urban areas and are prominent in the civil service and the professions.</p> <br>

		<p>The similarity in the dialect and culture makes the two ethnic grouped together. Traditionally, most of them were farmers, cultivating paddy rice and upland rice. Other livelihoods were fishing and hunting. This ethnic combines smaller groups such as Dusun Liwan, Dusun Lotud, Badahak, Tagahas, Tangara, Rungus, Orang Sungai, Kuijau, Tambanuo and many others. Sumazau is their traditional dance, as an appreciation after a successful harvest, usually on Kaamatan Festival. </p>

	<center><h4>The Bajau Tribe</h4></center>
		<img src="images/culture3.jpg" height="400px">
		<p>Bajau is divided into two groups according to their territory. While the Bajaus in the west coast were farmers and fishermen with their extraordinary horse riding skills, the Bajaus in the east coast were farmers and skilled divers. Bajau people that lived in the west coast were called Bajau Samah and they lived around Putatan, Tuaran, Kota Marudu, Kota Belud and Papar. In the east coast, most of them lived around Kudat, Sandakan, Lahad Datu, Kunak, Semporna and Tawau. An interesting fact about the Bajau in Kota Belud is that they learned how to make samurai swords from the Japanese army long time ago and the quality of the swords rival the Japanese samurai sword. Even though the two groups are both Bajau, in terms of speech, costume, traditional food and culture are different. </p>

	<center><h4>The Rungus Tribe </h4></center>
		<img src="images/culture4.jpg" height="400px">
		<p>The Rungus living in the Kudat district are known to have maintained their ancient traditions to this day. Even the traditional ladies costume has not many changes made to it. Some of the women still wear costumes made from cloth processed form hand-grown and hand-spun cotton. The Rungus are also well-known for their beadwork and the costume shows off some of their finest.</p>

	<center><h4>The Murut Tribe</h4></center>
		<img src="images/culture5.jpg" height="400px">
		<p>Literally "Murut" means hill people". They inhabit the interior and southeastern parts of Sabah and the territory straddling the Kalimantan and Sarawak borders. They were onced feared head-hunters. Most Muruts live in three districts, Tenom, Keningau and Pensiangan where they were mainly longhouse dwellers. They are mostly shifting cultivators and hunters with some riverine fishing. Besides, hunting with a blowpipe and spear, they also gather jungle produce such as rattan and resin as well as plant paddy. Those of Murut origin speak 15 languages and 21 dialects. The language commonly used and understood by the large majority is Tanggal. Their language is also related to the Kadazandusun languages.</p> <br>
	
		<p>The Murut people are the last group in Sabah to renounce headhunting as it is their spiritual belief that a man could not get married unless he presented at least one enemy’s head to the family of his desired girl. Like Kadazan-Dusun, Murut people also have their own harvest festival, called Kalimaran Festival.</p></center>

	<center><h3>Folk Tale of Sabah’s Ethnic Groups Origins</h3>
		<p>Islam is the official religion in both Malaysia and Brunei. Proper dress and manners should be adhered at all times. It’s customary to remove shoes before entering a mosque as well as homes. In places of worship, visitors should remove their shoes and women should ensure that their head, knees and arms are covered. They should not pass in front of people at prayer and should not touch the Quran. Nude sunbathing is not allowed and is very frowned upon. Avoid pointing your index finger at others, or to beckon someone with fingers and palm facing upwards as this is considered rude in the local custom. Instead the whole hand should be waved with palm facing downwards. Gifts, particularly food, are passed with the right hand.</p><br>

		<p>Apart from the Sabahans’ very own diverse mother tongues, Bahasa Malaysia (national language) and English is widely spoken; Mandarin and some Chinese dialects are also widely spoken. In Sabah, we greet people by saying “selamat datang” (welcome) and/or “terima kasih” (thank you) with a smile. Due to religious reasons, some may prefer not to have physical contact with others. However, a handshake is generally acceptable as a way of introducing oneself.</p></center>
